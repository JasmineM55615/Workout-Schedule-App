#My Project Proposal
####*By: Jasmine Mann*

My application is a workout schedule planner that will allow the user to create a daily workout plan where they can 
input exercises, information about each exercise, comments, and check off each exercise when they have completed it. 
This application is intended for those who work out and who are interested in fitness and a healthy lifestyle. I chose 
to implement this application as I am very interested in fitness and am someone who works out regularly. I often use the
notes app on my iPhone to check off exercises as I complete them in the gym but am unable to easily organize my workout 
schedule by providing sets, repetitions, comments, and other information for each exercise. This prompted me to choose 
this as my project so I can use it myself, as well as provide others with an application to easily plan and stay 
organized with their workouts.
 
###**Features I plan to add:**
- input for exercises where user will be allowed to check off each item
- input for sets & reps
- input for rest time, weights to use, tempo, and additional comments

##Phase 4: Task 2
I have chosen option 3 to implement (the use of the Map interface). The class that uses
the Map interface is the addButtonClicked class in my WorkoutScheduleGUI 


##Phase 4: Task 3
I wish I did some refactoring in my WorkoutScheduleGUI as some of the methods performed similar tasks. 
- I would have created a different method that some of these similar methods both would call
